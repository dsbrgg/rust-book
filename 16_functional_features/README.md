# Closures and Iterators

- Closures, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
- Iterators, a way of processing a series of elements
- The performance of these two features (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than you might think!)

Other Rust features, such as pattern matching and enums, which we’ve covered in other chapters, are influenced by the functional style as well. Mastering closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust code.
