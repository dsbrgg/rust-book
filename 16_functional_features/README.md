# Closures and Iterators

- Closures, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
- Iterators, a way of processing a series of elements
- The performance of these two features (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than you might think!)

Other Rust features, such as pattern matching and enums, which we’ve covered in other chapters, are influenced by the functional style as well. Mastering closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust code.

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: taking ownership, borrowing mutably, and borrowing immutably. These are encoded in the three Fn traits as follows:

- `FnOnce` consumes the variables it captures from its enclosing scope, known as the closure’s environment. To consume the captured variables, the closure must take ownership of these variables and move them into the closure when it is defined. The Once part of the name represents the fact that the closure can’t take ownership of the same variables more than once, so it can be called only once.

- `FnMut` can change the environment because it mutably borrows values.

- `Fn` borrows values from the environment immutably.

If you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the environment, you can use the `move` keyword before the parameter list. This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so it’s owned by the new thread.
