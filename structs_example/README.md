# Example Program using Structs

- Run `cargo run`

## Method syntax

Methods are different from functions in that they're defined withinthe context of a struct
(or a enum or a trait object), and their first parameter is always `self` , which represents 
the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

To define a method we start the struct context the method will be in. We start with a 
`impl` keyword following with the struct's name, then we continue with the `fn` keyword
following with the method's name.

Note that the `self` parameter is represented as a reference (`&self`). Methods can take
ownership of `self`, borrow `self` immutably as we've done on the program or borrow `self` mutably just as any other parameter. For reading the data only of the struct, `&self` is the best option, if we were to change something on the struct's instance then `&mut self` would be used. Using `self` only on the parameter is rare and is a technique usually used when the method transforms `self` into something else and you want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.

## Where's the `->` Operator

C and C++ have two operators for calling methods: `.` if you're calling a method on the object directly and `->` if you're calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the pointer first. In other words, it `object` is a pointer: `object-something()` is similar to `(*object).something()`.

Rust doesn't have and equivalent of `->` because it has a feature called *automatic referencing and derefencing*.

When calling `object.something()`, Rust automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so `object` matches the signature of the method. The following are the same:

```rust
p1.distance(&p2); == (&p1).distance(&p2);
```

The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a clear receiverâ€”the type of `self`. Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`). The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice.
