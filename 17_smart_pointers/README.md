# Smart Pointers

Smart pointers, are data structures that not only act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities. The concept of smart pointers isn’t unique to Rust: smart pointers originated in C++ and exist in other languages as well. In Rust, the different smart pointers defined in the standard library provide functionality beyond that provided by references. One example that we’ll explore in this chapter is the *reference counting* smart pointer type. This pointer enables you to have multiple owners of data by keeping track of the number of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.

In Rust, which uses the concept of ownership and borrowing, an additional difference between references and smart pointers is that references are pointers that only borrow data; in contrast, in many cases, smart pointers **own** the data they point to.

`String` and `Vec<T>` both count as smart pointers because they own some memory and allow you to manipulate it. They also have metadata (such as their capacity) and extra capabilities or guarantees (such as with String ensuring its data will always be valid UTF-8).

Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs. The characteristic that distinguishes a smart pointer from an ordinary struct is that smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits. The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so you can write code that works with either references or smart pointers. The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that is run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.

## `Box<T>` to Point to data on the Heap

Boxes don’t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don’t have many extra capabilities either. You’ll use them most often in these situations:

- When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size

- When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so

- When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type
