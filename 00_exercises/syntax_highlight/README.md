Rules:

- `F` - Wrap this command around `<span style="color: pink">` and `</span>` tags so that it is highlighted pink in our editor
- `L` - Wrap this command around `<span style="color: red">` and `</span>` tags so that it is highlighted red in our editor
- `R` - Wrap this command around `<span style="color: green">` and``</span>` tags so that it is highlighted green in our editor
- Digits from `0` through `9` - Wrap these around `<span style="color: orange">` and `</span>` tags so that they are highlighted orange in our editor
- Round Brackets - Do not apply any syntax highlighting to these characters
