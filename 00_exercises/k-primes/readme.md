# Exercise description

A natural number is called k-prime if it has exactly k prime factors, counted with multiplicity.

A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-prime.

```
Examples of k-primes:
k = 2 -> 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, …
k = 3 -> 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, …
k = 5 -> 32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, …
```

The k-prime numbers are not regularly spaced. Between 2 and 50 we have the following 2-primes:

```
[4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46, 49]
```

The steps between two consecutive k-primes are `2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 6, 1, 3, 1, 7, 1, 1, 3, 1, 7, 3`.

We will write a function `kprimes_step(k, step, start, nd)` with parameters:

- `k` (integer > 0) which indicates the type of k-primes we are looking for,
- `step` (integer > 0) which indicates the `step` we want to find between two k-primes,
- `start` (integer >= 0) which gives the start of the search (start inclusive),
- `nd` (integer >= start) which gives the end of the search (nd inclusive)

In the example above `kprimes_step(2, 2, 0, 50)` will return `[[4, 6], [33, 35]]` which are the pairs of 2-primes between 2 and 50 with a 2 steps.

So this function should return an array of all the pairs (or tuples) of k-prime numbers spaced with a `step` of step between the limits `start`, `nd`. This array can be empty.

## Examples

```
kprimes_step(2, 2, 0, 50) => [[4, 6], [33, 35]]
kprimes_step(6, 14, 2113665, 2113889) => [[2113722, 2113736]])
kprimes_step(2, 10, 0, 50) => [[4, 14], [15, 25], [25, 35], [39, 49]]
kprimes_step(5, 20, 0, 50) => []
