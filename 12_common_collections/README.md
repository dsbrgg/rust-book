# Common Collections

- *Vector* allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- *string* is a collection of characters.
- *Hash map* allows you to associate a vlue with a particular key.

Unlike arrays or tuples, these collections are stored on the heap which means it's not necessary to know their size at compile time. Each has different capabilities and costs.

For other kinds of collections on the standard library, [check this out](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html).
